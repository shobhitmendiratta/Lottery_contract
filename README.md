# Lottery_contract

I developed a smart contract called "Lottery", designed to function as a structured lottery or raffle system, featuring a prize pool and a participant registry. This smart contract enables participants who enter the raffe to contribute a specified amount of ether, initiating their participation in the game and simultaneously bolstering the prize pool. After a predetermined number of participants have entered, a designated third party known as the "Chief" can instruct the contract to randomly select a winner, emphasizing that the Chief merely prompts the smart contract to make the decision. The contract then meticulously chooses a winner from the list of participants and disburses the entire prize pool to the selected winner. Subsequently, the Lottery Contract resets itself, becoming prepared to accept a new group of players, thus perpetuating the lottery process.
